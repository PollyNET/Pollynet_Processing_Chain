## Anaconda installation

### Windows

-> TODO

### Linux


#### Download the Anaconda installation script

Navigate to the `/tmp` directory and download the Anaconda installation script using the link that you copied from the Downloads page:

```
cd /tmp
curl -O https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-5.3.1-Linux-x86_64.sh
```

#### Verify the Data Integrity of the script

Use the `sha256sum` command to verify the script checksum:

```
sha256sum Anaconda3-5.3.1-Linux-x86_64.sh
```

You should see an output like the following:

```
Output
d4c4256a8f46173b675dd6a62d12f566ed3487f932bab6bb7058f06c124bcc27  Anaconda3-5.3.1-Linux-x86_64.sh
```

Make sure the hash printed from the command above matches the one available at the Anaconda with Python 3 on 64-bit Linux page for your appropriate Anaconda version.

#### Run the Anaconda Installation Script

To start the Anaconda installation process run the installation script:

```
bash Anaconda3-5.3.1-Linux-x86_64.sh
```

You should see the output like the following:

```
Welcome to Anaconda3 5.3.1

In order to continue the installation process, please review the license
agreement.
Please, press ENTER to continue
```

Press `ENTER` to continue and then press `ENTER` to scroll through the license. Once you’re done reviewing the license, you’ll be asked to approve the license terms:

```
Do you accept the license terms? [yes|no]
```

Type `yes` to accept the license and you’ll be prompted to choose the installation location.

```
Anaconda3 will now be installed into this location:
/home/linuxize/anaconda3

    - Press ENTER to confirm the location
    - Press CTRL-C to abort the installation
    - Or specify a different location below
```

The default location is fine for most users, press `ENTER` to confirm the location and installation process will continue.

If you get an error saying `bunzip2: command not found`, install the `bzip2` package with: `sudo yum install bzip2`.

The installation may take some time and once it is completed, the following output will be displayed:

```
Installation finished.

Do you wish the installer to initialize Anaconda3
in your /home/linuxize/.bashrc ? [yes|no]
```

If you want to use the conda command type `yes` press `ENTER` and you’ll be presented the following output:

```
Appending source /home/linuxize/anaconda3/bin/activate to /home/linuxize/.bashrc
A backup will be made to: /home/linuxize/.bashrc-anaconda3.bak

For this change to become active, you have to open a new terminal.

Thank you for installing Anaconda3!
```

The installer will also ask you whether you would like to download and install Visual Studio Code.

```
Anaconda is partnered with Microsoft! Microsoft VSCode is a streamlined
code editor with support for development operations like debugging, task
running and version control.

To install Visual Studio Code, you will need:
    - Administrator Privileges
    - Internet connectivity

Visual Studio Code License: https://code.visualstudio.com/license

Do you wish to proceed with the installation of Microsoft VSCode? [yes|no]
```

You can find more information about [Visual Studio](https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-install-visual-studio-code-on-centos-7/) on the editor [website](https://code.visualstudio.com/). If you want to install Visual Studio Code type `yes` otherwise type `no`.

To activate the Anaconda installation load the new `PATH` environment variable which was added by the Anaconda installer into the current shell session with the following command:

```
source ~/.bashrc
```

#### Verify the Installation

You can verify your Anaconda installation using the `conda` command. For example to display information about current conda install type:

```
conda info
```

```

#### Updating Anaconda

Updating the Anaconda is a pretty straight forward process, first update the conda tool with:

```
conda update conda
```

When prompted to confirm the update, type `y` to proceed.

Once conda is updated, proceed with the Anaconda update:

```
conda update anaconda
```

Same as with the previous command, when prompted, type `y` to proceed.

You should regularly update your Anaconda installation.
